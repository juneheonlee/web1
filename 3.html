<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often
abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
 conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is
 high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
 t has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object
 -orientation, and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of th
e core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of we
bsites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorpora
ting third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicat
ed JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
